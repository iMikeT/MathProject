# ODE Python Code

Here is all the Python code used in my presentation for using Python with solving ODE equations given at the end of first semester in third year. 

I have included the presentation PDF and the latex file using Beamer. Also the video I made to demonstrate the faster convergence between to numerical meathods is included as the YouTube like is no longer active.
